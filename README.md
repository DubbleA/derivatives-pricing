# C++ Derivatives Pricing Engine

## Roadmap

##### using Mark Joshi's C++ Design Patterns & Derivatives Pricing as reference

### Simple Monte Carlo Model
- Simple procedural model for pricing a call option
- Option pricer for calls

### OOP
- Implement Encapsulation for vanilla options
- Encapsulation
- Implement Pay off class
- Inheritance and virtual functions
- Virtual Destruction
- Adding extra payoffs without changing files
- Bridging with a virtual constructor

### Strategies decoration and statistics
- Design better pay-off class by using inheritance
- Differing outputs
- Design statistics gatherer
- Create a convergence table
- Decoration 

### Create Random numbers class for backtesting
- Anti-thetic sampling via decoration
- Using number generator class

### An exotics engine and template pattern
- Designing, Identifying, and Implementing components
- A black-scholes path generation engine

### Implementing Trees to price derivatives

### Solvers, templates, and implied volatilities
- Function Objects
- Newton-Raphson and function template arguments
- Outline pros and cons of templatization

### The factory
- Automate Registration
- Revist Design patterns
- Refactor code
